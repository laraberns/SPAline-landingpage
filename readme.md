# SPAline - Spa Landing Page

SPAline is a responsive landing page designed for a SPA, showcasing SPA services and providing a registration form for users to receive discounts. The primary purpose of creating this landing page is to demonstrate practical usage of SCSS (Sass), including the use of variables, functions, and nesting for class styles. Additionally, SCSS is used to modularize the stylesheet by creating partials, making it easier to maintain, update, and edit.
